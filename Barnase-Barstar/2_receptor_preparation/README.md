# Receptor simulation

PDBID: 1BRS

## Tasks

- Extract a barnase receptor from the 1BRS pdb (the longest one, chain B?) and write a new pdb file with it.
- Check if the receptor has missing atoms, residues or terminals. Check if all aminoacids are
  common aminoacids.
- Add missing atoms.
- Add hydrogens to the molecule. Do you see residues that could be with a differen protonation
  state? What happens with them when you change the pH of the environment to protonate the system?
- Get the charge (coulombic) of the protein. Is neutral? What are the charged residues?
- Solvate the system with TIP3P water molecules in a truncated octahedral box with the protein in
  the center and the limits of the box 14 angstroms away from the protein surface (at least).
- Did you add ions to the box?
- Explore the openmm object: Topology
